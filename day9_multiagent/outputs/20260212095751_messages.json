Authors Cole Stryker Staff Editor, AI Models IBM Think Eda Kavlakoglu Business Development + Partnerships IBM Research What is AI? Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy. Applications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects. They can understand and respond to human language. They can learn from new information and experience. They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts.\u00a0They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car). But in 2024, most AI researchers, practitioners and most AI-related headlines are focused on breakthroughs in generative AI\u00a0(gen AI), a technology that can create original text, images, video and other content. To fully understand generative AI, it\u2019s important to first understand the technologies on which generative AI tools are built: machine learning\u00a0(ML) and deep learning.

Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. There are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including linear regression,\u00a0logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines\u00a0(SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), clustering and more. Each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data. But one of the most popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a neural network (or artificial neural network). Neural networks are modeled after the human brain's structure and function. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data. Neural networks are well suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. The simplest form of machine learning is called supervised learning, which involves the use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. In supervised learning, humans pair each training example with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in the training data, so it can predict the labels of new, unseen data. Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, that more closely simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. Deep neural networks include an input layer, at least three but usually hundreds of hidden layers, and an output layer, unlike neural networks used in classic machine learning models, which usually have only one or two hidden layers. These multiple layers enable unsupervised learning: they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents. Because deep learning doesn\u2019t require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a tremendous scale. It is well suited to natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today. In a deep neural network, multiple layers of nodes can extract meaning and relationships from large volumes of unstructured, unlabeled data. Deep learning also enables: Semi-supervised learning, which combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train AI models for classification and regression tasks. Self-supervised learning, which generates implicit labels from unstructured data, rather than relying on labeled data sets for supervisory signals. Reinforcement learning, which learns by tri",
